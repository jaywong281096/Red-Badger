# Red-Badger

For this programming problem I decided to emphasise simplicity and worked with the limited amount
of time as suggested in the guidelines. A part of this is also because I am currently really busy.
However I made sure to meet most/all of the requirements suggested.

Within the files I have commented some improvements or different ways I would have approached the problem
given more time. If you would like me to provide a more efficient/extensible solution to this problem I would be
happy to provide it, as I feel this may not fully display my capability in programming and I am eager to proceed to the next
stage of this process.

To run this program simply use command line to compile and pass in the arguments
For example:

Sample Input
5 3
1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL
0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL

Would look like : java Main 53 11E RFRFRFRF 32N FRRFLLFFRRFLL 03W LLFFFLFLFL

The next steps I would take if given more time would to provide a GUI for easier use, so that it would be much
easier to pass in the arguments. Could also provide a visualisation of the grid and robot movements.

I would increase the efficiency and reduce code by using enumerations for the directions (NESW)/use a command pattern to group together commands
for more extensibility.

Another important thing I would include is more robust validation checking for arguments. This could be part of the GUI.
