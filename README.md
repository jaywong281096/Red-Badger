# Red-Badger

For this programming problem I decided to emphasise simplicity and worked with the limited amount
of time as suggested in the guidelines. I believe to be able to work quickly and write simple functional code
is part of the values of Agile Development however a part of this is also because I am currently really busy.
I have made sure to meet most/all of the requirements suggested.

Within the files I have commented some improvements or different ways I would have approached the problem
given more time. If you would like me to provide a more efficient/extensible solution to this problem I would be
happy to provide it, as I feel this may not fully display my capability in programming and I am eager to proceed to the next
stage of this process.

To run this program simply use command line to compile and pass in the arguments.

For example:

java Main 53 11E RFRFRFRF 32N FRRFLLFFRRFLL 03W LLFFFLFLFL

The next steps I would take if given more time would be to provide a GUI for easier use, so that it would be much
easier to pass in the arguments. Could also provide a visualisation of the grid and robot movements.

I would also increase the efficiency and reduce code by using enumerations for the directions (NESW)/use a command pattern to group together commands
for more extensibility.

More robust validation checking for arguments could also be added. This could be part of the GUI.

If there are any issues with the program please let me know. I have checked most edge cases but may have missed some.
